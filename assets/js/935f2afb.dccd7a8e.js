These operations can be very useful to make holes and rounded shapes. For example, in the image below there is a grey block and a red cylinder that is moved in X-, and Z-direction.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"basic/conditional":{"id":"basic/conditional","title":"Logic","description":"Conditional statements, or if-then-else statements, can be used to make smart objects that have different geometry based on certain logic or rules. For example, suppose you want to make a ruler with units where every 5-ths unit has a different size and color. You can start with a block inside a repeat loop.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"basic/primitives":{"id":"basic/primitives","title":"Primitives","description":"The Basic mode is an intermediary mode between Block box and Advanced. All dimensions of the basic objects can be set. The default grey color can be changed by inserting a color statement and pick a color from the palette. Instead of separate move commands for the direction you can now move directly in 3D by entering X, Y and Z coordinates. The X correspond to the red direction, the Y to the green direction and the Z to the blue direction.  The X-, and Y-movements are in the plane showing the grid and the Z-direction is upwards from the plane.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"basic/repeat":{"id":"basic/repeat","title":"Repetition","description":"Repetition is one of the most powerful elements in a progamming language. It is also very useful in 3D programming to create objects with patterns. Repetition statements allow you to create these patterns very quickly and you can change them easily at any time. Let start with a simple shape that includes a block and a cylinder.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"blockbox/challenge":{"id":"blockbox/challenge","title":"Challenge","description":"Now that we have explained the basics of creating, moving and turning objects you can try it yourself. There are many ways to create the same object but in general the fewer statements you need the better.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"blockbox/create":{"id":"blockbox/create","title":"Add","description":"Block box is the most simple mode. To start the block box mode click on create in the gallery and select mode Block box. The screen is divided into three parts: a library with blocks, a workspace where you can place blocks and a 3D model viewer.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"blockbox/move":{"id":"blockbox/move","title":"Move","description":"Move statements are for setting the position of an object.  When you drag an object to the workspace it is always aligned with the axis. In this case we drag a cylinder block from the library to the workspace. By default the cylinder has a height of 2 and you can modify this to any other value.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"blockbox/turn":{"id":"blockbox/turn","title":"Turn","description":"Turn statements are used to rotate an object. When placing a cylinder it is placed along the blue axis and points upwards. This is useful if you want to model a pole but not if you want to model a wheel of a car.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"contact/contact":{"id":"contact/contact","title":"Axxem B.V.","description":"Axxem develops systems for acquisition and analysis of IoT data, visualization and 3D modeling. Application areas include education, home automation, archicture, engineering, construction and facilities management.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"gallery/overview":{"id":"gallery/overview","title":"Gallery","description":"When the app is started you see a gallery with demo objects. You can enter a search term or click on a picture to view or modify. If you click on the three dots you see a menu with options to delete, open or copy and object.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"gallery/settings":{"id":"gallery/settings","title":"Settings","description":"Click on the settings icon in the main page to set the language or default mode. You can also restore the app to the original state. This removes all objects that have been created and restores the demo objects.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"gallery/workspace":{"id":"gallery/workspace","title":"Workspace","description":"To create a new object click on the create icon and select one of the modes. Each mode has a special workspace. You will learn more about the workspaces in the next sections.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/concept":{"id":"introduction/concept","title":"Welcome","description":"This application is intended for quick and easy generation of 3D objects using a technique called visual programming. You can make complex objects with built-in logic just by drag-and-drop programming statements.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/education":{"id":"introduction/education","title":"Education","description":"Computer programming is fun and a great tool to help student develop skills in computational thinking. Several countries are including basics of programming as a mandatory part of the curriculum for primary education.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/installation":{"id":"introduction/installation","title":"Installation","description":"If you just want to have a feel for the application without installing you can use the online demo version. You just need a standard web browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"introduction/licensing":{"id":"introduction/licensing","title":"Licensing","description":"No license fees are currently required for personal use and use in free public education such as schools and universities.
