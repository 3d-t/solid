# Solid: Visual Programming in 3D

This is a website with documentation on Solid, an app for visual programming in 3D. It supports the following:

* Generation of 3D models by drag-and-drop visual code blocks
* Generation of 3D models via JavaScript
* Loops and conditional statements 
* Combining shapes via add, subtract and intersect operations
* Materials
* Key frame animation
* Libraries with parametrized parts
* Real time visualization in 3D in a web browser
* Different modes with reduced complexity
* Generation of GTLF models for importing in other 3D packages
* Generation of STL models for 3D printing

A live version of this web site and a demo of the app are available on [https://solid.engineer](https://solid.engineer)
